# Skelocity - Skript Addon for Networks
Skelocity is a Skript addon built to give you control over your proxy networks with Skript.
All features have been tested and work on Velocity server software, and Skelocity should also work for BungeeCord networks.

## Features
- Get the player count of the whole proxy network
- Get the player count of a specific server on the proxy
- Get which server a player is on
- Get a list of all players on the whole proxy network
- Get a list of all players on a specific server on the proxy
- Send network-wide broadcast messages (MiniMessage + Legacy support)
- Kick a player from the entire proxy from the server they are on, with an optional reason (MiniMessage + Legacy support) (prevents them being sent to the next server in priority)
